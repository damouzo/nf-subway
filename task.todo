# Main TODOs for nf-subway

- [x] [Parser] Support both Nextflow output formats:
      - '[id] process > NAME ...'
      - '[id] NAME ...'
- [x] [Renderer] True git-graph style visualization:
      - Fixed color palette for lanes/branches (as in git-graph)
      - Branching and connectors with clear Unicode lines
      - Right-aligned annotations: job ID, name, progress
      - Support both 'vertical', 'horizontal', and 'auto'
      - Truncate content where space is limited
- [x] [CLI] Implement the --orientation flag with correct propagation
- [x] [Monitor] Pass orientation from CLI through the monitor to renderer
- [ ] [Tests] Cover both Nextflow formats and all layouts
      - Should include real-world Nextflow pipeline outputs
      - Golden output comparisons or visual snapshotting for regression
- [ ] [UX] Clear message if no process detected
      - Explain when output line format is not recognized
- [ ] [Docs] Keep AGENTS.md thorough and current
- [ ] [Cleanup] Use a focused and accurate .gitignore
- [x] [Demo] Include a minimal Nextflow pipeline for quick demo/testing
- [x] [Final] Deliver a concise README for install and usage

- [ ] [Renderer] Compact, continuous git-graph aesthetics (new update)
      - Make lane spacing more compact (closer to reference image)
      - Keep branch lines visually continuous (avoid broken segments)
      - Preserve vertical flow top→bottom with git-graph look-and-feel

- [ ] [Renderer] Pixel-perfect terminal git-graph
      - Match lane width, dot/line alignment, and merge geometry to reference
      - Remove all visual discontinuities and maximize resemblance to git-graph

- [ ] [CLI] Repair --no-original flag functionality
      - Is hidden but nf-subway not show perfectly without it, so should be fixed and documented

- [ ] [CLI] --orientation horizontal show dots but not lines or process names (bug)
      - Lines should be rendered in horizontal mode as well, but currently only dots are shown
      - Process names and annotations should also be visible in horizontal layout

# Optional
- [ ] Export graph visualization to SVG/HTML or image
- [ ] Configurable dark/light mode
- [ ] CI/CD integration: test, lint, type-check hooks
